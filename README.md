# How to use python venv
## **Make venv**
`python -m venv [venv]`

> NOTE: [venv] can be whatever, I usually just leave it as "venv"

> NOTE: if you don't name it as "venv" please add what ever you name it to the .gitignore and commit that

> NOTE: this *probably* does not work with anaconda/conda, please use normal python.

## **Activate venv**
MAC/LINUX: `source venv/bin/activate`

WINDOWS: `venv\Scripts\Activate`

## **Load requirements**
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

> NOTE: Make sure to activate the venv

## **Update requirements**
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

> NOTE: Make sure the venv is activated

> NOTE: Make sure to commit and push update
